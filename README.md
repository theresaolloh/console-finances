# Module Four Challenge

## Project Overview

In this challenge, you'll be using the concepts you've learned to complete the required activity. This activity presents a real-world situation in which your newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. You are tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. You have been provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file.

## Brief / Acceptance Criteria

We have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. Our task was to write JavaScript code that analyzed the records to calculate each of the following:
* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When the code is opened in the browser, the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 25
  Total: $2561231
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

The final code should print the analysis to the console.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* VS Code 
* Git and GitHub

## Wins / Key Learnings
A key learning for me was understanding how to work with nested arrays and how to use for loops to iterate over the array, in this instance, for financial anaylsis.
